Framework for creating a professional README provided by: (https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)
Starter code was provided by the UCSD Bootcamp. Ternary operators were taught by TA Sophia in office hours. Javascript functions like writeFileSync figured out through discussions with classmates.
